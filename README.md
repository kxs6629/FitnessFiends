This is the followup to my project [WorkoutVisualizer](https://github.com/kxs6629/WorkoutVisualizer)

## Overview
There is a lot of tech that I haven't used since college in this one. So it should be interesting to see what I can get up and running.

## Tech Stack (Tentative)
* PostgreSQL
* Spring Boot Java for REST API
* Next.JS for FrontEnd
    - Node.JS as well apparently
    - TypeScript
