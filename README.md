# FitnessFiends
This is the followup to my project [WorkoutVisualizer](https://github.com/kxs6629/WorkoutVisualizer)

## Overview
There is a lot of tech that I haven't used since college in this one. So it should be interesting to see what I can get up and running.

* [Spring Boot (v3.4.2 on JDK 21)](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) : REST API
* [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started) :  Front End
    - [Tailwind](https://tailwindui.com/?ref=top)
